This is a Vim extension that emulates iA Writer environment when editing Markdown, reStructuredText or text files.

It requires [goyo.vim](https://github.com/junegunn/goyo.vim) and it works by setting global Goyo callbacks that triggers special setup for Markdown, reStructuredText and text files.

This is an improvment of my initial version called [vim-zenroom](https://github.com/amix/vim-zenroom). Please read more here [
